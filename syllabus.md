### Course on Moduli of Curves, Ribbon Graphs, and Witten's Conjecture

#### Detailed Syllabus (tentative)

I will try to keep the course accessible without assuming too much background knowledge. Some basic understanding of manifolds and Riemann surfaces should be enough. I will list more details about the Topological Recursion later in the course.

Part I: The Geometry of Moduli Spaces

This first part of the course builds the geometric foundations. The primary goal is to construct the moduli space $\mathcal M_{g,n}$ and its compactification​ as a geometric object, using the language of hyperbolic geometry and complex analysis.

Key Definitions & Theorems:

- Hyperbolic metric on a surface   

- Teichmüller Space

- Pair of pants decomposition    

- Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates (length and twist parameters)

- Mapping Class Group, Nielsen-Thurston classification of mapping classes

- Nodal curve

- Stability condition

- Deligne-Mumford compactification      

- Boundary strata and their recursive structure    

Part II: The Combinatorics of Moduli Spaces

This part of the course introduces the second pillar: the combinatorial description of $\mathcal M_{g,n}$​ via ribbon graphs. This will provide the essential tool for Kontsevich's proof.

Key Definitions & Theorems:


- Ribbon graph / Fat graph    

- Geometric realization of a ribbon graph into a surface    

- Cell decomposition of the moduli space indexed by ribbon graphs

Part III: Intersection Theory and Matrix Models

This part introduces the intersection-theoretic problem that motivated Witten, and solves it using the combinatorial machinery and a surprising connection to physics. We will start with tautological classes on $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$ and define intersection numbers on $\overline{\mathcal M}_{g,n}$ and their generating functions.

Witten's Conjeture states that this generating function satisfies a series of partial differential equations, i.e. KdV hierarchy. Kontsevich's formula express this generating function in terms of ribbon graphs, which are also expressed by a matrix model. Kontsevich's proof eventually boils down to showing the integrable hierarchy for this matrix model.

Key Definitions & Theorems:

- Universal curve and tautological classes 

- Intersection numbers, generating function

- KdV Hierarchy

- Witten's Conjecture

- Hermitian matrix model

- Feynman diagrams, propagators, vertices

- Wick's Theorem for Gaussian integrals

- Kontsevich's proof on Witten's Conjecture
