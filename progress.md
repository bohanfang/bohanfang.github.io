This is a not very detailed record on what happened in each course meeting. There should be course recordings in [北大教学网](https://course.pku.edu.cn).

### Sep 08

We discussed the definition of Teichmuller space, and the differentiable structure of $\mathrm{Teich}(T^2)$. 

Reference: [FM], pages 263-269. 


### Sep 10

We discussed the *algebraic topology* of $\mathrm{Teich}(S_g)$, by identifying it with $\mathrm{DF}(\pi_1(S_g),PSL(2,\mathbb R))/PGL(2,\mathbb R)$.

Then we show that $\mathrm{Teich}(S_0^3)\cong\mathbb R^3_+$, by considering the lengths of the three boundaries.

Any closed surface can be decomposed into pairs of pants. We defined twisting parameters using *seams*. 

Reference: [FM], pages 269-282.

### Sep 15

We discussed Fenchel-Nielson coordinates for Teichmuller space, and in particular, showed that $\mathrm{Teich}(S_g)\cong \mathbb R^{3g-3}_+\times \mathbb R^{3g-3}$.

Teichmuller space can be regarded as the space of *marked* hyperbolic surfaces, or as the space of *marked* complex structures. We introduced quasi-conformal maps, and stated Teichmuller's result on the Teichmuller metric using quasi-conformal maps.

Reference: [FM], pages 282-287, 294-300.

### Sep 22

We discussed *measured foliations* and *quadratic differentials* $\mathrm{QD}(X)$ on a Riemann surface, possibly bordered and punctured. These two concepts are closed related and essentially equivalent. We defined Teichmuller mappings based on the definition of quadratic differentials. We also computed $\mathrm{dim}_{\mathbb C} \mathrm{QD}(X)=3g-3$.
