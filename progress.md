This is a not very detailed record on what happened in each course meeting. There should be course recordings in [北大教学网](https://course.pku.edu.cn).

### Sep 08

We discussed the definition of Teichmuller space, and the differentiable structure of $\mathrm{Teich}(T^2)$. 

Reference: [FM], pages 263-269. 


### Sep 10

We discussed the *algebraic topology* of $\mathrm{Teich}(S_g)$, by identifying it with $\mathrm{DF}(\pi_1(S_g),PSL(2,\mathbb R))/PGL(2,\mathbb R)$.

Then we show that $\mathrm{Teich}(S_0^3)\cong\mathbb R^3_+$, by considering the lengths of the three boundaries.

Any closed surface can be decomposed into pairs of pants. We defined twisting parameters using *seams*.
