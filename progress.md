This is a not very detailed record on what happened in each course meeting. There should be course recordings in [北大教学网](https://course.pku.edu.cn).

### Sep 08

We discussed the definition of Teichmuller space, and the differentiable structure of $\mathrm{Teich}(T^2)$. 

Reference: [FM], pages 263-269. 


### Sep 10

We discussed the *algebraic topology* of $\mathrm{Teich}(S_g)$, by identifying it with $\mathrm{DF}(\pi_1(S_g),PSL(2,\mathbb R))/PGL(2,\mathbb R)$.

Then we show that $\mathrm{Teich}(S_0^3)\cong\mathbb R^3_+$, by considering the lengths of the three boundaries.

Any closed surface can be decomposed into pairs of pants. We defined twisting parameters using *seams*. 

Reference: [FM], pages 269-282.

### Sep 15

We discussed Fenchel-Nielson coordinates for Teichmuller space, and in particular, showed that $\mathrm{Teich}(S_g)\cong \mathbb R^{3g-3}_+\times \mathbb R^{3g-3}$.

Teichmuller space can be regarded as the space of *marked* hyperbolic surfaces, or as the space of *marked* complex structures. We introduced quasi-conformal maps, and stated Teichmuller's result on the Teichmuller metric using quasi-conformal maps.

Reference: [FM], pages 282-287, 294-300.

### Sep 22

We discussed *measured foliations* and *quadratic differentials* $\mathrm{QD}(X)$ on a Riemann surface, possibly bordered and punctured. These two concepts are closed related and essentially equivalent. We defined Teichmuller mappings based on the definition of quadratic differentials. We also computed $\mathrm{dim}_{\mathbb C} \mathrm{QD}(X)=3g-3$. 

Reference: [FM], pages 300-305, 309-312.

## Sep 24

As an example, we studied the Swiss Cross as a construction of a genus $2$ Riemann surface together with a quadratic differential. We stated the Teichmuller existence and uniquess theorem, and explained the diffeomorphism map between $\mathrm{QD}_1(X)$ and $\mathrm{Teich}(S)$. The Teichmuller metric is a complete metric defined by the dilatation of the Teichmuller map relating two conformal structures. 

Reference: [FM], pages 313-315, 320-323, 330-332, 337-341.

## Oct 15

We introducted *mapping class groups*, and discussed several examples (disk, annulus, torus with zero or $1$ marked points, $S_{0,3}$ and $S_{0,4}$.) We introduced the concept of the moduli space of (smooth) conformal/hyperbolic structures, and discussed the example of $\mathcal M(T^2)$.

Reference: [FM], Chapter 2, pages 342-349.
